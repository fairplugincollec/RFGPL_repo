MODIFIED ver of GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

NAMED AS REALISTIC FAIR GENERAL PUBLIC PRIVACY LICENSE,or in short RFGPL

Version 1,September 2020,

THIS LICENSE is generally a superset of GNU GPL Ver2. This license aim to fix some of the Open source license holes that are not expected in past but exposed as technology advances.

A SOFTWARE FILTER is defined as any sequence of instruction executions in hardware that result in a split of possibilities,

MATH DEF:a sequence of instruction execution can be defined as f(x) or simply in common name a function,let the exposed and publicly known be f(x)=1,and given 1,1=f(x).The result is the same as f(x)=x/1.As f(x)=1 and f(x)=1/x WHEN GIVEN X=1 ,will return 1

AS such one of the general properties is implementation may be different but have same result,the ideal case is not dependent on variable.AS a constant is always fair and have no other possibilites.

In which any SOFTWARE FILTER will have a transparency property and a is masked property

a)Transparent,user have no idea or easy way to determine the existence of filter,can be generalized as no feedback in User Interface.

b)Partial Transparent,user know the existence of filter. However, it's full intend or use is not fully specified or conveyed to users.can be generalized as having effects and clarify SOME uses.

c)SOLID,user knows the existence of the filter it's uses and the effects,can be generalized as a high quality systematic sequence of programs.

d)Masked,the exposed or stated intent is not the real intent,In short Fake and untrustable filter.

e)Unmasked,the exposed or stated intent is the real intent,The software does what it is expected to do.

Thus any software filter can be defined as one of the six type,as 3transpancy state* 2mask state= 6total state or type

STATUS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECT OR SOFTWARE

a)Active:the development is active and may have periodic updates that have constant investment(not only financial investment).
All license statement is active and applicable,failure of uphelding the license will have payment.By default no statement of inactive will be assumed to be active

b)Inactive:the development is inative and one may have some development going but enhancement may be irrelevant to the public releases or is already an archived software by developer.
All license statement is active and applicable except payment for failure.By default only projects that doesn't have any update in a full 365 days will then trigger project to be inactive.
ANY project or software that does not want to be maintained should release their final release with Inactive keyword or any synonym keyword or simply state it clearly.

Lossy summary:If you start a new standalone project no worries just do your development and you when you want to archive just add a Inactive keyword into the license statement
that is in the last release.Hooray,you can go enjoy your life.If found someone violate the license by creating derivatives that is closed source and resell it,take action.
If found someone release the derivative source intentionally in some platform where end users are filtered by some sketchy process and most user fails to get the source.Take action.

List of relevant entities in this license.
SOFTWARE AND SOURCE DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM,SOFTWARE USES THIS LICENSE AND IT'S DERIVATIVES,SOFTWARES STATICALLY RELATED TO SOFTWARES USES THIS LICENSE

a)SOFTWARE AND SOURCE DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM:A SERVICE OR TOOLS That have specific entity bound to,can try get relevant entity's parent up to two layers.
AS in The attempt to define a entity that is responsible for the system or service.
	
b)SOFTWARE USES THIS LICENSE AND IT'S DERIVATIVES:ANY software that uses this license and fullfill the conditions of having a valid license.

c)Derivatives:Expected definition usage range only in this license to prevent conflicts,Any software that has similarities above 49% compared to source in content.
Simple renaming in contents will be not be counted as difference. 

d)SOFTWARES STATICLY RELATED TO SOFTWARES USES THIS LICENSE:Any statically linked software is of course included in this entity.Any software linking or compiling that
 will only happens in runtime with at least 50% of the info about the Software which uses this license is known at runtime is not included as this entity.

PAYMENT FOR FAILURE:The amount of payment for failure is stackable.Each payment of failure is worth a value equilavent 99 meals.Where each meal is calculated using simple mean from all
eatable food that is avaliable in the developers surrounding area.The consumption of payment must not bound to a single provider.One may say generally money is the payment method to go...
Of course failure to give payment is also going to trigger Payment for Failure.However when failure to give payment is triggered three times in a row then trigger Intellectual property
Infringement on the subject failing to pay for failing to upheld the license.

MOD0. Defintion for a valid license statement giving a general idea on usage and also replaces some references specified on GPL 
a)states the Copyright owner with year and name of author.Digital Signature can be used on Copyright section and if used whoever can reproduce the Signature
will be proved to be the owner and ownership can only be transferred if proven original owner transfers ownership on own will.
b)clearly states which license version and full license name.
c)clearly states the software is free software and is distributed without any warranty in any purpose.
d)gives a copy of license without modification.

SOFTWARE AND SOURCE DISTRIBUTION
MOD1. SOFTWARE USES THIS LICENSE AND IT'S DERIVATIVES and SOFTWARES STATICLY RELATED TO SOFTWARES USES THIS LICENSE MUST NOT be included in any project,program,or software that have biased distribution system for it's SOFTWARE AND SOURCE Distribution.
The Strict defnition is,The utilized distribution system for delivering SOFTWARE AND SOURCE to end user must not have any masked partial transparent filter,that in one of the possibilites result in the end user fails to obtain a unmodified SOFTWARE AND SOURCE.
REAL EG1 MOD1. There's a website in China had Open Source as it's initiative and aim,but if and only if you as end user has a China phone number and is registered in it's server.
PROVE EG1 MOD1. Thus,any so called Open source projects is actually partially open source or simply biased open source,The full derivation of limitation is as BELOW
PROJECT>USER REQUEST GET COPY>(Partial Transparent FILTER)>(HAVE ACC,NO ACC)>(Sucess,Failed).
a)HAVE ACC,derived>OWN China phone number,having a common China Social Media,HAVE China I.C.,Is a China Citizen
b)NO ACC,derived>DID NOT OWN a China phone number,not having a common China Social Media,NO CHINA I.C.,NOT a China citizen
Lossy general definition,any distribution method or platform that needs more information that the minimum required info to transfer the SOFTWARE and SOURCE should be avoided if possible.

MOD2. Modification statements in this license must be upheld in any circumstances,failure to do so in any circumstances will result in void of license.
The developments for software without license MUST be stopped as soon as possible in any circumstances.Failure to do so within 7 working days for the development team.
The license can only be valid if and only if the Payment for Failure triggered and the licensee received the payment.

MOD3. Regarding the hardware limitation on software modifications.ANY hardware limitation on software modification is not allowed except the software in question is mainly for health
critical software or hard realtime application.

MOD4. Replacement of the section 9 in GPL License.As this license is not licensed under any organization or a significant Open Source community.
Currently there's is no dependable way to display any updated version from license creator.One may stumble upon newer version of this license in some Open-Source projects. 

MOD5. Any derivation of this license must not have same full name with this license and the modifications is generally suggested to not use a new name but instead a new version.

MOD6. ANY derivatives may use a compatible license.
Conditions to be a compatible license.
a)An open source license where one can create open source derivatives of the software,the copyright of original software is retained by original owner.
b)Payment for Failure to uphelding license is provided.

ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW IS INCLUDED AS A STATIC BASELINE AS IN FIXED VERSION AND IS PART OF THE MODIFIED LICENSE

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
